# Just some setup

The goal of this repository is to serve as a collection point for boilerplating and automating my personal OS setup.

## Software

### Dev
- [ ] Base
  - [ ] ZSH
  - [ ] Tmux
  - [ ] Git
  - [ ] Hub
  - [ ] Docker
  - [ ] CircleCI CLI
  - [ ] Heroku CLI
- [ ] Node
  - [ ] nvm

## Data
The point of all this software is to use it. As it consumes and produces data, the filesystem gets dirty with data not necessarily replicated to the cloud. This data might be:
- [ ] Projects
- [ ] Pictures
- [ ] Documents (should remain empty in favor of Google Drive)
- [ ] Home folder (usually ends up dirty for whatever reason)

## Open problems
- Selecting which dependencies to install (?) (subsets/optionals)
- How to test? CircleCI? Docker? VM? (See: https://github.com/mviereck/x11docker)
- Selecting base OS/compatibility with multiple OS

### Testing

- [ ] Commands
- [ ] GUIs
